# Math Applications â€“ Introductory Python Scripts

This project includes Python scripts that solve basic algorithmic tasks:
- Prime factorization of a number
- Identifying the store with the highest total profit
- Finding all indices of a digit in a given string

## Files

- `211819958-Q1HW1.py`:  
  Checks if a number is prime and computes its prime factorization based on user input.

- `211819958-Q2HW1.py`:  
  Determines which store has the highest total profit from a given list.

- `211819958-Q3HW1.py`:  
  Finds all indices of a specific digit in a user-provided string (e.g., ID number).

## Usage

1. **Prime Factorization**  
   Run `211819958-Q1HW1.py` and enter a number when prompted. The script will return its prime factorization.

2. **Best Store by Profit**  
   Run `211819958-Q2HW1.py` to see which store has the highest total profit.

3. **Find Digit Indices**  
   Run `211819958-Q3HW1.py`, then input a string and a digit. The script will return the positions where the digit appears.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries needed
